This is a TI-Basic Program written in about 1-2 weeks and finshed at Tue 25.10.2016

The program has been written and tested on a TI-84 Plus Calculator; parts of it (mainly strings) have been written in Windows 7 with the TI-Connect CE Editor.

This software is distributed AS IS and WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, even without the warranty to work correctly on your device.

As herein concluded, there are three versions:

1. Matrix.txt - The sourcecode
2. MATRIXD.8xp - The final program to be executed on the calculator, unprotected -> you can view and/or modify the sourcecode on the calculator itself
3. MATRIX.8xp - The final program, protected -> Sourcecode can't be viewed or modified on the calculator itself.

Additionally, Matrix.png is a snapshot of the running program.

NOTE: You need TI-Connect (available only for Windows and macOS) to transfer the file(s) to your TI-Calculator.
